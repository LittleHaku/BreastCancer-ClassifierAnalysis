Classifiers are a really helpful tool, but they are a black box, that is, they are fed with an input and provide an output, but we do not know why they made a certain decision. This is a problem in the medical field since we need to know why a certain decision was made; for example, if a patient has cancer, we need to know which features determine that the patient has cancer, and which ones determine that the patient does not have cancer. This is where \ac{xai} comes into play, \ac{xai} is a branch of \ac{ai} that is focused on making \ac{ml} models transparent, explaining why a certain decision was made and allowing doctors to understand the decision \cite{borys_explainable_2023}.
