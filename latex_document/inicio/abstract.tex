This 
thesis \ab{Bachelor thesis}
presents a comparative analysis of base and ensemble classifiers for breast cancer detection and the use of 
eXplainable AI (XAI) \ab{here the problem is different: you have never defined AI but used it directly, and later on you define again XAI -- see how you can rephrase this to, either not use AI here, but Artificial Intelligence, or introduce first AI, and later define XAI as eXplainable AI}
to interpret the results. The initial phase involves constructing and optimizing the classifier models, these classifiers will analyze the results from fine needle biopsy aspirations and classify the samples as benign or malignant.

Following this, a performance comparison is conducted comparing metrics such as the F1 score or the recall. The aim is to identify the best classifier regarding our metrics. Once the best classifier model is found, we dive deeper into it to understand how it works. For this, we will use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a method of XAI 
(eXplainable AI) \ab{this can be removed}
that allows us to see the importance of each feature, and how they contribute to the final decision of the model. This will allow us to not only classify the samples but also to understand why the model has made that decision which can be a step forward in understanding AI models for medical purposes.
