I would like to thank my tutor Alejandro Bellog√≠n Kouki for the guidance he has provided me throughout the development of this thesis, from the freedom he has given me, to the advice and feedback he has provided me. Also, to the rest of the teachers who have been part of my academic training, for their dedication and for sharing their knowledge with me.

I would also like to give my most sincere thanks to my family, especially my mother, my sister, and my aunt, for their support, for helping me with proofreading, and for always being there for me.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends for their support and encouragement, and for the good times we have shared during this time.
