Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions of women \cite{wcrf_international_breast_nodate} each year. As the most common cancer type among women \cite{wcrf_international_breast_nodate}, it demands continuous research and innovation to improve early detection and treatment outcomes. Classifiers have the potential to assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer along with \ac{xai} techniques, which can provide explanations for the model's predictions. Thus, in this thesis, we aim to develop a machine-learning model that can classify breast cancer \ac{fnab} as benign or malignant and provide explanations for the model's predictions. In this chapter, we will introduce the motivation and objectives of the project, as well as the structure of the thesis.
