The main goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that can classify breast cancer fine needle aspiration biopsies as benign or malignant and to provide an explanation of the model's predictions. To achieve this goal, different classifiers will be built and optimized using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The classifiers will be compared based on a set of selected metrics, and the best one will be chosen. The project will also include the implementation of the SHAP library to provide explanations for the model's predictions. This will provide a global and local explanation of the model's predictions. The global explanation will show the importance of each feature in the model, while the local one will show the contribution of each feature to a specific prediction.

Additionally, a web application will be developed to allow users to see all the models' hyperparameters, metrics, feature importance, and a selection of predictions with their explanations.
