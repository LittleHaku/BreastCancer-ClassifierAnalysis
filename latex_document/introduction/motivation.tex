Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women \cite{wcrf_international_breast_nodate}; in 2020, there were more than 2.26 million women diagnosed with breast cancer \cite{wcrf_international_breast_nodate}, being the second leading cause of death among women in the United States \cite{american_cancer_society_breast_nodate}. Early detection is a crucial step for improving survival rates. With the current analysis techniques of FNAB (Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy), we have a sensitivity (ability of a test to identify positive cases correctly) of 0.927 \cite{yu_diagnostic_2012}. Therefore, there is a need for a more accurate interpretation of those tests.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data and extract patterns from it to be then able to generalize it to unseen data. In this case, we care about classifiers, whose potential is in the ability to learn from a dataset and then on unseen data being able to classify it as one class or another; in this case, we will be able to classify as benign or malign the results of a fine needle aspiration.

The potential of classifiers in breast cancer detection is immense. However, the effectiveness of the different classifiers can vary; this is why it is crucial to understand how each classifier works, how to tweak it, and how to make them as precise and effective as possible, which is the goal of this thesis.

Finding the best possible classifier for this problem would impact cancer detection tasks, facilitating healthcare professionals in their diagnostic responsibilities and, ultimately, improving patient outcomes.
