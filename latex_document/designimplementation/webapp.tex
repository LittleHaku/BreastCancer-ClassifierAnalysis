To make the results more accessible and visually appealing, we have built a web application using \textit{Django}. This framework was used because \textit{Python} has been the main programming language used in the project and \textit{Django} was the most familiar framework in that language. For the front-end, we used \ac{html}, \ac{css}, and \ac{js}. The web application is hosted in \textit{Render} with the database in \textit{Neon}, which makes it publicly accessible using this 
\href{https://breast-cancer-classification-web.onrender.com/}{link}, \ab{perhaps it is good to also 'print' the link, so if someone (this will not happen, but...) prints the document, knows where to go...}.
Since the free hosting of \textit{Render} is not always available, we have also made a video showing the web application in action, this video can be found in this 
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZASpsVNhXPA}{link} \ab{same comment as before}
or if not the project can be run locally cloning the 
\href{https://github.com/LittleHaku/breast-cancer-classification-web}{code repository}. \ab{idem}
The home page of the web application is shown in Figure \ref{FIG:HOMEPAGE}, an example of the comparison of two classifiers that can be prepared using the application is shown in Figure \ref{FIG:COMPARISON}.
