As it has been previously mentioned the dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset \cite{william_wolberg_breast_1993}. This dataset is composed of 569 samples of breast masses obtained by \ac{fnab}, then these samples were parametrized into ten different features, meaning that now we will work with numbers instead of images. Then, each of the ten features is divided into three features, the mean, standard error, and worst, which although it sounds like it is the worst value, actually is the average of the three worst values.


Before using these values in the classifier we first need to understand the dataset, this is done using \ac{eda} techniques. This involves, first, obtaining a general understanding of the dataset, then visualizing the dataset, and finally understanding the relationships between the features. All of this is done only using the training set to avoid data leakage.
