After seeing a statistical overview of the dataset, we can now dive into visualizing the dataset. This is done using the \textit{matplotlib} and \textit{seaborn} libraries. With these libraries, we will be able to see more visually the distribution of the target variable, the distribution of the features, and the relationships between the features. To achieve this, we will use histograms, correlation matrices, pair, density, and violin plots among others. This will give us a better understanding of the dataset and the relationships between the features which will allow us to make more informed decisions when preprocessing the dataset and building the classifiers.
