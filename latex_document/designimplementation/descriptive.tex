To have a general understanding of the dataset we can use the \textit{pandas} library to load the dataset and then use the \textit{.describe()} method to see an overview of the features in the dataset, their mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values; and then use the \textit{.skew()} method to see the skewness of the features. With this, we would have the needed descriptive statistics of the dataset.
