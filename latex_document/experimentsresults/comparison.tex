This section discusses the results obtained from optimizing the classifiers' hyperparameters to obtain the best possible performance, as it was explained in Section \ref{SEC:BUILDING}, we first used \textit{RandomizedSearchCV} to bound the hyperparameters' search space and then used \textit{GridSearchCV} to fine-tune them; the metrics used were: F1-Score, Recall, F2-Score, and Precision.

We first present the results of the base classifiers, followed by the ensemble classifiers that, when possible, were optimized using the same hyperparameters as the base classifiers. Finally, we compare the best base and ensemble classifiers to determine which one is the most suitable for the problem.
