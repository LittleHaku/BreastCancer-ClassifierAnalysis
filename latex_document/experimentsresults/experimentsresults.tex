This chapter will showcase the results of the aforementioned experiments. We will start by showing the \acl{eda} of the dataset, then we will compare the performance of the classifiers, and, finally, we will analyze the \ac{shap} values to understand the importance of the features in the classifiers.

These results can be reproduced by running the code in the \textit{Jupyter Notebook} that is available in the \textit{GitHub} repository \href{https://github.com/LittleHaku/BreastCancer-ClassifierAnalysis}{https://github.com/LittleHaku/BreastCancer-ClassifierAnalysis}.
