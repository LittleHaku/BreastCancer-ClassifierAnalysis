This paper presents a breast cancer detection approach where the convoluted features from a convolutional neural network are utilized to train a machine learning model. Results demonstrate that use of convoluted features yields better results than the original features to classify malignant and benign tumors.

Abstract
Breast cancer is a common cause of female mortality in developing countries. Screening and early diagnosis can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of these cancers. This study proposes an ensemble learning-based voting classifier that combines the logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent classifier with deep convoluted features for the accurate detection of cancerous patients. Deep convoluted features are extracted from the microscopic features and fed to the ensemble voting classifier. This idea provides an optimized framework that accurately classifies malignant and benign tumors with improved accuracy. Results obtained using the voting classifier with convoluted features demonstrate that the highest classification accuracy of 100\% is achieved. The proposed approach revealed the accuracy enhancement in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

This study proposed using the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm, Borderline- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for hyperparameter tuning to enhance the effectiveness of the Machine Learning (ML) model for diagnosing breast cancer. A 10-fold cross-validated TPE optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM classifier was modelled on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset and evaluated for its performance compared to a baseline LightGBM model. The TPE-optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM model exhibited a significant improvement in performance over the baseline model, achieving an average accuracy of 99.12\%, specificity of 100\%, precision of 100\%, recall of 97.62\%, F1-score of 98.80\%, and a Mathews Correlation Coefficient of 98.12\%. Compared to previous studies, the TPE-optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM model performed exceptionally well. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve the performance of ML models for breast cancer diagnosis, which has significant implications for the medical field where the accurate and efficient diagnosis of breast cancer is critical.},

Current methods require consultation with experts, which is expensive and time-consuming and thus may not be accessible to all. This paper seeks to train and evaluate supervised machine learning models for the accurate and efficient detection of breast cancer. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database dataset describes 30 attributes of cell nuclei, including, but not limited to, their radius, texture, and concavity. It contains 569 instances, 212 of which are malignant tumors. The Random Forest algorithm outperforms other algorithms in classifying breast tumors as either malignant or benign and is thus selected as our primary model. It is trained on two different subsets of the dataset having 16 and 8 features, respectively, identified with the help of multiple feature selection methods. The Random Forest models are tested post hyperparameter tuning on a holdout set, and accuracies of 100\% and 99.30\% respectively. The models are also compared with four other machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The results confirm that Random Forest is the superior method for breast cancer diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Biomarker-based cancer identification and classification tools are widely used in bioinformatics and machine learning fields. However, the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression data poses a challenge for identifying important genes in cancer diagnosis. Many feature selection algorithms optimize cancer diagnosis by selecting optimal features. This article proposes an ensemble rank-based feature selection method (EFSM) and an ensemble weighted average voting classifier (VT) to overcome this challenge. The EFSM uses a ranking method that aggregates features from individual selection methods to efficiently discover the most relevant and useful features. The VT combines support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree algorithms to create an ensemble model. The proposed method was tested on three benchmark datasets and compared to existing built-in ensemble models. The results show that our model achieved higher accuracy, with 100\% for leukaemia, 94.74\% for colon cancer, and 94.34\% for the 11-tumor dataset. This study concludes by identifying a subset of the most important cancer-causing genes and demonstrating their significance compared to the original data. The proposed approach surpasses existing strategies in accuracy and stability, significantly impacting the development of ML-based gene analysis. It detects vital genes with higher precision and stability than other existing methods.},

	abstract = {Background
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the breast is a minimally invasive yet maximally diagnostic method. However, the clinical use of FNAB has been questioned. The purpose of our study was to establish the overall value of FNAC in the diagnosis of breast lesions.

Methods
After a review and quality assessment of 46 studies, sensitivity, specificity and other measures of accuracy of FNAB for evaluating breast lesions were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall accuracy. The sensitivity and specificity for the studies data (included unsatisfactory samples) and underestimation rate of unsatisfactory samples were also calculated.

Results
The summary estimates for FNAB in diagnosis of breast carcinoma were as follows (unsatisfactory samples was temporarily exluded): sensitivity, 0.927 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.921 to 0.933); specificity, 0.948 (95\% CI, 0.943 to 0.952); positive likelihood ratio, 25.72 (95\% CI, 17.35 to 28.13); negative likelihood ratio, 0.08 (95\% CI, 0.06 to 0.11); diagnostic odds ratio, 429.73 (95\% CI, 241.75 to 763.87); The pooled sensitivity and specificity for 11 studies, which reported unsatisfactory samples (unsatisfactory samples was considered to be positive in this classification) were 0.920 (95\% CI, 0.906 to 0.933) and 0.768 (95\% CI, 0.751 to 0.784) respectively. The pooled proportion of unsatisfactory samples that were subsequently upgraded to various grade cancers was 27.5\% (95\% CI, 0.221 to 0.296).

Conclusions
FNAB is an accurate biopsy for evaluating breast malignancy if rigorous criteria are used. With regard to unsatisfactory samples, futher invasive procedures are required in order to minimize the chance of a missed diagnosis of breast cancer.},

Hence, our aim is to develop a pathology-independent classifier that provides prediction probabilities and explanations of the classification decisions. Spinal posture data of healthy subjects and various pathologies (back pain, spinal fusion, osteoarthritis), as well as synthetic data, were used for modeling. A one-class support vector machine was used as a pathology-independent classifier. The outputs were transformed into a probability distribution according to Platt’s method. Interpretation was performed using the explainable artificial intelligence tool Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations. The results were compared with those obtained by commonly used binary classification approaches. The best classification results were obtained for subjects with a spinal fusion. Subjects with back pain were especially challenging to distinguish from the healthy reference group. The proposed method proved useful for the interpretation of the predictions. No clear inferiority of the proposed approach compared to commonly used binary classifiers was demonstrated. The application of dynamic spinal data seems important for future works. The proposed approach could be useful to provide an objective orientation and to individually adapt and monitor therapy measures pre- and post-operatively.},

Using Shapley values, we determined the IDE driving features according to two periods, often adopted in clinical practice, of 5 and 10 years from the first tumor diagnosis.ResultsAge, tumor diameter, surgery type, and multiplicity are predominant within the 5-year frame, while therapy-related features, including hormone, chemotherapy schemes and lymphovascular invasion, dominate the 10-year IDE prediction. Estrogen Receptor (ER), proliferation marker Ki67 and metastatic lymph nodes affect both frames.DiscussionThus, our framework aims at shortening the distance between AI and clinical practice},

This effort quickly prompted new, powerful algorithms that reach a far higher accuracy, but at the cost of losing intelligibility, such as Gradient Boosting or ensemble methods. These models are usually referred to as “black-boxes”, implying that you know the inputs and the output, but there is little way to understand what is going on under the hood. As a response to that, we have seen several different Explainable AI models flourish in recent years, with the aim of letting the user see why the black-box gave a certain output. In this context, we evaluate two very popular eXplainable AI (XAI) models in their ability to discriminate observations into groups, through the application of both unsupervised and predictive modeling to the weights these XAI models assign to features locally. The evaluation is carried out on real Small and Medium Enterprises data, obtained from official italian repositories, and may form the basis for the employment of such XAI models for post-processing features extraction.},

We combined a LightGBM model with SHAP, which enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. The LightGBM model clearly outperforms the bank’s actual credit scoring model (Logistic Regression). We found that the most important explanatory variables for predicting default in the LightGBM model are the volatility of utilized credit balance, remaining credit in percentage of total credit and the duration of the customer relationship. Our main contribution is the implementation of XAI methods in banking, exploring how these methods can be applied to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art AI models. We also suggest a method for analyzing the potential economic value of an improved credit scoring model.},

	abstract = {Following visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.},

	abstract = {Objective. To explain and underscore the use of principal component analysis in clinical biomechanics as an expedient, unbiased means for reducing high-dimensional data sets to a small number of modes or structures, as well as for teasing apart structural (invariant) and variable components in such data sets. Design. The method is explained formally and then applied to both simulated and real (kinematic and electromyographic) data for didactical purposes, thus illustrating possible applications (and pitfalls) in the study of coordinated movement.
Background. In the sciences at large, principal component analysis is a well-known method to remove redundant information in multidimensional data sets by means of mode reduction. At present, principal component analysis is starting to penetrate the fundamental and clinical study of human movement, which ampliﬁes the need for an accessible explanation of the method and its possibilities and limitations. Besides mode reduction, we discuss principal component analysis in its capacity as a data-driven ﬁlter, allowing for a separation of invariant and variant properties of coordination, which, arguably, is essential in studies of motor variability.
Methods. Principal component analysis is applied to kinematic and electromyographic time series obtained during treadmill walking by healthy humans.
Results. Common signal structures or modes are identiﬁed in the time series that turn out to be readily interpretable. In addition, the identiﬁed coherent modes are eliminated from the data, leaving a ﬁltered, residual pattern from which useful information may be gleaned regarding motor variability.
Conclusions. Principal component analysis allows for the detection of modes (information reduction) in both kinematic and electromyographic data sets, as well as for the separation of invariant structure and variance in those data sets.},

We group protein crystallization images into 3 categories: noncrystals, likely leads (conditions that may yield formation of crystals) and crystals. In this research, we only consider the subcategories of noncrystal and likely leads protein crystallization images separately. We use 5 different classifiers to solve this problem and we applied some data preprocessing methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), min-max (MM) normalization and z-score (ZS) normalization methods to our datasets in order to evaluate their effects on classifiers for the noncrystal and likely leads datasets. We performed our experiments on 1606 noncrystal and 245 likely leads images independently. We had satisfactory results for both datasets. We reached 96.8\% accuracy for noncrystal dataset and 94.8\% accuracy for likely leads dataset. Our target is to investigate the best classifiers with optimal preprocessing techniques on both noncrystal and likely leads datasets.},

Although many performance metrics have been proposed in machine learning community, no general guidelines are available among practitioners regarding which metric to be selected for evaluating a classifier’s performance. In this paper, we attempt to provide practitioners with a strategy on selecting performance metrics for classifier evaluation. Firstly, the authors investigate seven widely used performance metrics, namely classification accuracy, F-measure, kappa statistic, root mean square error, mean absolute error, the area under the receiver operating curve, and the area under the precision-recall curve. Secondly, the authors resort to using Pearson linear correlation and Spearman rank correlation to analyses the potential relationship among these seven metrics. Experimental results show that these commonly used metrics can be divided into three groups, and all metrics within a given group are highly correlated but less correlated with metrics from different groups.},

This paper systematically reviewed the related evaluation metrics that are specifically designed as a discriminator for optimizing generative classifier. Generally, many generative classifiers employ accuracy as a measure to discriminate the optimal solution during the classification training. However, the accuracy has several weaknesses which are less distinctiveness, less discriminability, less informativeness and bias to majority class data. This paper also briefly discusses other metrics that are specifically designed for discriminating the optimal solution. The shortcomings of these alternative metrics are also discussed. Finally, this paper suggests five important aspects that must be taken into consideration in constructing a new discriminator metric.},

	title = {Random {Search} for {Hyper}-{Parameter} {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efﬁcient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to conﬁgure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks conﬁgured by a pure grid search, we ﬁnd that random search over the same domain is able to ﬁnd models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search ﬁnds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising conﬁguration space. Compared with deep belief networks conﬁgured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional conﬁguration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for conﬁguring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent “High Throughput” methods achieve surprising success—they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

	abstract = {Driven by recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV), the implementation of AI systems in the medical domain increased correspondingly. This is especially true for the domain of medical imaging, in which the incorporation of AI aids several imaging-based tasks such as classification, segmentation, and registration. Moreover, AI reshapes medical research and contributes to the development of personalized clinical care. Consequently, alongside its extended implementation arises the need for an extensive understanding of AI systems and their inner workings, potentials, and limitations which the field of eXplainable AI (XAI) aims at. Because medical imaging is mainly associated with visual tasks, most explainability approaches incorporate saliency-based XAI methods. In contrast to that, in this article we would like to investigate the full potential of XAI methods in the field of medical imaging by specifically focusing on XAI techniques not relying on saliency, and providing diversified examples. We dedicate our investigation to a broad audience, but particularly healthcare professionals. Moreover, this work aims at establishing a common ground for cross-disciplinary understanding and exchange across disciplines between Deep Learning (DL) builders and healthcare professionals, which is why we aimed for a non-technical overview. Presented XAI methods are divided by a method’s output representation into the following categories: Case-based explanations, textual explanations, and auxiliary explanations.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

@article{wolpert_stacked_nodate,
	title = {{STACKED} {GENERALIZATION}},
	abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation’s crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},
