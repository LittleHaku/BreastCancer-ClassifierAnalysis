This paper presents a breast cancer detection approach where the convoluted features from a convolutional neural network are utilized to train a machine learning model. Results demonstrate that use of convoluted features yields better results than the original features to classify malignant and benign tumors.

Abstract
Breast cancer is a common cause of female mortality in developing countries. Screening and early diagnosis can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of these cancers. This study proposes an ensemble learning-based voting classifier that combines the logistic regression and stochastic gradient descent classifier with deep convoluted features for the accurate detection of cancerous patients. Deep convoluted features are extracted from the microscopic features and fed to the ensemble voting classifier. This idea provides an optimized framework that accurately classifies malignant and benign tumors with improved accuracy. Results obtained using the voting classifier with convoluted features demonstrate that the highest classification accuracy of 100\% is achieved. The proposed approach revealed the accuracy enhancement in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.},

This study proposed using the Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm, Borderline- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) for hyperparameter tuning to enhance the effectiveness of the Machine Learning (ML) model for diagnosing breast cancer. A 10-fold cross-validated TPE optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM classifier was modelled on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset and evaluated for its performance compared to a baseline LightGBM model. The TPE-optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM model exhibited a significant improvement in performance over the baseline model, achieving an average accuracy of 99.12\%, specificity of 100\%, precision of 100\%, recall of 97.62\%, F1-score of 98.80\%, and a Mathews Correlation Coefficient of 98.12\%. Compared to previous studies, the TPE-optimized Borderline-SMOTE LightGBM model performed exceptionally well. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve the performance of ML models for breast cancer diagnosis, which has significant implications for the medical field where the accurate and efficient diagnosis of breast cancer is critical.},

Current methods require consultation with experts, which is expensive and time-consuming and thus may not be accessible to all. This paper seeks to train and evaluate supervised machine learning models for the accurate and efficient detection of breast cancer. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database dataset describes 30 attributes of cell nuclei, including, but not limited to, their radius, texture, and concavity. It contains 569 instances, 212 of which are malignant tumors. The Random Forest algorithm outperforms other algorithms in classifying breast tumors as either malignant or benign and is thus selected as our primary model. It is trained on two different subsets of the dataset having 16 and 8 features, respectively, identified with the help of multiple feature selection methods. The Random Forest models are tested post hyperparameter tuning on a holdout set, and accuracies of 100\% and 99.30\% respectively. The models are also compared with four other machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Multilayer Perceptron, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The results confirm that Random Forest is the superior method for breast cancer diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Biomarker-based cancer identification and classification tools are widely used in bioinformatics and machine learning fields. However, the high dimensionality of microarray gene expression data poses a challenge for identifying important genes in cancer diagnosis. Many feature selection algorithms optimize cancer diagnosis by selecting optimal features. This article proposes an ensemble rank-based feature selection method (EFSM) and an ensemble weighted average voting classifier (VT) to overcome this challenge. The EFSM uses a ranking method that aggregates features from individual selection methods to efficiently discover the most relevant and useful features. The VT combines support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and decision tree algorithms to create an ensemble model. The proposed method was tested on three benchmark datasets and compared to existing built-in ensemble models. The results show that our model achieved higher accuracy, with 100\% for leukaemia, 94.74\% for colon cancer, and 94.34\% for the 11-tumor dataset. This study concludes by identifying a subset of the most important cancer-causing genes and demonstrating their significance compared to the original data. The proposed approach surpasses existing strategies in accuracy and stability, significantly impacting the development of ML-based gene analysis. It detects vital genes with higher precision and stability than other existing methods.},

	abstract = {Background
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the breast is a minimally invasive yet maximally diagnostic method. However, the clinical use of FNAB has been questioned. The purpose of our study was to establish the overall value of FNAC in the diagnosis of breast lesions.

Methods
After a review and quality assessment of 46 studies, sensitivity, specificity and other measures of accuracy of FNAB for evaluating breast lesions were pooled using random-effects models. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall accuracy. The sensitivity and specificity for the studies data (included unsatisfactory samples) and underestimation rate of unsatisfactory samples were also calculated.

Results
The summary estimates for FNAB in diagnosis of breast carcinoma were as follows (unsatisfactory samples was temporarily exluded): sensitivity, 0.927 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.921 to 0.933); specificity, 0.948 (95\% CI, 0.943 to 0.952); positive likelihood ratio, 25.72 (95\% CI, 17.35 to 28.13); negative likelihood ratio, 0.08 (95\% CI, 0.06 to 0.11); diagnostic odds ratio, 429.73 (95\% CI, 241.75 to 763.87); The pooled sensitivity and specificity for 11 studies, which reported unsatisfactory samples (unsatisfactory samples was considered to be positive in this classification) were 0.920 (95\% CI, 0.906 to 0.933) and 0.768 (95\% CI, 0.751 to 0.784) respectively. The pooled proportion of unsatisfactory samples that were subsequently upgraded to various grade cancers was 27.5\% (95\% CI, 0.221 to 0.296).

Conclusions
FNAB is an accurate biopsy for evaluating breast malignancy if rigorous criteria are used. With regard to unsatisfactory samples, futher invasive procedures are required in order to minimize the chance of a missed diagnosis of breast cancer.},

Research is needed regarding pathology-independent classifiers and their interpretation. Hence, our aim is to develop a pathology-independent classifier that provides prediction probabilities and explanations of the classification decisions. Spinal posture data of healthy subjects and various pathologies (back pain, spinal fusion, osteoarthritis), as well as synthetic data, were used for modeling. A one-class support vector machine was used as a pathology-independent classifier. The outputs were transformed into a probability distribution according to Platt’s method. Interpretation was performed using the explainable artificial intelligence tool Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations. The results were compared with those obtained by commonly used binary classification approaches. The best classification results were obtained for subjects with a spinal fusion. Subjects with back pain were especially challenging to distinguish from the healthy reference group. The proposed method proved useful for the interpretation of the predictions. No clear inferiority of the proposed approach compared to commonly used binary classifiers was demonstrated. The application of dynamic spinal data seems important for future works. The proposed approach could be useful to provide an objective orientation and to individually adapt and monitor therapy measures pre- and post-operatively.},

However, such approaches are poorly interpretable.MethodsThus, we designed an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to investigate IDEs within a cohort of 486 breast cancer patients enrolled at IRCCS Istituto Tumori “Giovanni Paolo II” in Bari, Italy. Using Shapley values, we determined the IDE driving features according to two periods, often adopted in clinical practice, of 5 and 10 years from the first tumor diagnosis.ResultsAge, tumor diameter, surgery type, and multiplicity are predominant within the 5-year frame, while therapy-related features, including hormone, chemotherapy schemes and lymphovascular invasion, dominate the 10-year IDE prediction. Estrogen Receptor (ER), proliferation marker Ki67 and metastatic lymph nodes affect both frames.DiscussionThus, our framework aims at shortening the distance between AI and clinical practice},

	abstract = {In credit risk estimation, the most important element is obtaining a probability of default as close as possible to the effective risk. This effort quickly prompted new, powerful algorithms that reach a far higher accuracy, but at the cost of losing intelligibility, such as Gradient Boosting or ensemble methods. These models are usually referred to as “black-boxes”, implying that you know the inputs and the output, but there is little way to understand what is going on under the hood. As a response to that, we have seen several different Explainable AI models flourish in recent years, with the aim of letting the user see why the black-box gave a certain output. In this context, we evaluate two very popular eXplainable AI (XAI) models in their ability to discriminate observations into groups, through the application of both unsupervised and predictive modeling to the weights these XAI models assign to features locally. The evaluation is carried out on real Small and Medium Enterprises data, obtained from official italian repositories, and may form the basis for the employment of such XAI models for post-processing features extraction.},

This paper proposes an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for predicting credit default on a unique dataset of unsecured consumer loans provided by a Norwegian bank. We combined a LightGBM model with SHAP, which enables the interpretation of explanatory variables affecting the predictions. The LightGBM model clearly outperforms the bank’s actual credit scoring model (Logistic Regression). We found that the most important explanatory variables for predicting default in the LightGBM model are the volatility of utilized credit balance, remaining credit in percentage of total credit and the duration of the customer relationship. Our main contribution is the implementation of XAI methods in banking, exploring how these methods can be applied to improve the interpretability and reliability of state-of-the-art AI models. We also suggest a method for analyzing the potential economic value of an improved credit scoring model.},
